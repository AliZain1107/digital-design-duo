# AUGMENT MEMORIES - DIGITAL DESIGN DUO PROJECT

## General Preferences
- User prefers to maintain existing code structure and styling throughout the application, making only specific requested changes without modifying other components or sections.
- User prefers to push changes to new branches rather than directly to main branch.
- User wants debug information panels removed from production components.
- User prefers to break down large tasks like blog migration into smaller, manageable parts rather than doing everything at once.
- User prefers a systematic step-by-step approach for blog translation tasks and wants to continue with overall relocation of all remaining blog posts.

## Project Specific
- User wants to migrate all blog posts from https://www.styly.io/blog to the current React codebase website, creating bilingual (English/French) versions of all remaining blog posts.
- Footer elements should be linked to app.styly.io
- When French language is selected, the 'Commencer avec Styly.io' button should link to the French version of https://app.styly.io/ instead of the default English version.
- The Terms/Conditions page should use specific legal content including company details (ODK, 14 Rue Jean Jaurès, 92800, France), hosting info (AWS/Hostinger), and detailed terms covering free trial, paid plans, no-refund policy, and French law jurisdiction.
- User prefers French naming conventions for routes (e.g., /confidentialite, /conditions) and wants legal pages to follow the same component structure and styling as Terms.tsx for consistency.
- User prefers French URLs for blog posts.
- Blog post migration should follow established patterns: create component in src/blogPages/, extract all content including images to public folder, add French translations to i18n.ts, update App.tsx routing, maintain consistent Tailwind styling and SEO optimization.
- User prefers to migrate blog posts from external sites to the React codebase, maintaining all redirects and links, following the established pattern of creating bilingual components with French URLs.
- Cookie consent popups should appear after users scroll down on the page rather than immediately on page load.
- Landing page should display maximum 4 blog posts, showing only the latest added ones.
- User prefers minimal horizontal spacing between blog posts on the landing page for a more compact layout.

- User wants video guide pages to follow the structure and pattern of https://www.styly.io/video when creating new video guide pages.
- User prefers to remove both video guide and blog links from the header/navbar navigation.
- User prefers to include social media links at the end of each blog post following the established pattern used in existing posts.
- User prefers to include keywords when migrating blog posts for SEO optimization purposes.
- User prefers to migrate blog posts systematically 2 by 2 to ensure everything aligns properly during the migration process.
- User requires careful attention to French translation quality, especially for blog post titles, to ensure they are properly translated and not just literal conversions.

## Blog SEO Enhancements
- When creating blog articles, automatically add internal links to related blog posts, 1-2 external references from trusted sources (Elle Décoration, ArchDaily, Houzz, AD Magazine), and CTAs when detecting keywords related to interior design AI, renovation, decoration, specific rooms, or AI tools.

- For multilingual SEO, implement distinct URLs for each language (/en/blog/... and /fr/blog/...), add proper hreflang tags, ensure server-side rendering of language-specific pages, and implement the addAlternateLanguageLink function.
