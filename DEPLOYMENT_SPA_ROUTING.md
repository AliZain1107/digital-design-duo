# SPA Routing Configuration for Styly.fr

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Fixing 404 Errors for Direct URL Access

This document explains how to configure your server to handle React Router's client-side routing, which is **essential** for fixing 404 errors when users access URLs directly.

## 🔍 The Problem

React Router handles routing on the client-side, but when users access URLs directly (like `https://www.styly.fr/blog/science-couleur-design-comment-ia-aide-choisir-palette-parfaite/`), the server doesn't know about these routes and returns a 404 error.

## ✅ The Solution

Configure your server to serve `index.html` for all routes that don't match static files. This allows React Router to take over and handle the routing client-side.

## 🚀 Configuration Files Included

### 1. **Netlify/Vercel** - `public/_redirects`
✅ **Already configured** - The `_redirects` file has been updated with SPA routing support.

### 2. **Apache** - `public/.htaccess`
✅ **Ready to use** - Copy this file to your Apache server's document root.

### 3. **Vercel** - `vercel.json`
✅ **Ready to deploy** - Place in your project root for Vercel deployments.

### 4. **Nginx** - `nginx.conf`
✅ **Template provided** - Adapt the server block to your Nginx configuration.

## 📋 Deployment Instructions

### For **Netlify**:
1. ✅ The `public/_redirects` file is already configured
2. Deploy your `dist/` folder to Netlify
3. All routes will automatically work

### For **Vercel**:
1. ✅ The `vercel.json` file is ready
2. Deploy using `vercel --prod`
3. All routes will automatically work

### For **Apache**:
1. Copy `public/.htaccess` to your web server's document root
2. Ensure `mod_rewrite` is enabled
3. Upload your `dist/` folder contents
4. All routes will automatically work

### For **Nginx**:
1. Adapt the `nginx.conf` template to your server configuration
2. Update the `root` path to point to your `dist/` folder
3. Reload Nginx configuration: `sudo nginx -s reload`
4. All routes will automatically work

### For **AWS Amplify**:
1. Create a `_redirects` file in your build output (already included)
2. Amplify will automatically use the redirects configuration
3. All routes will automatically work

### For **GitHub Pages**:
1. Copy `public/index.html` to `public/404.html`
2. GitHub Pages will serve the 404.html for missing routes
3. React Router will handle the routing

## 🎯 What This Fixes

After proper configuration, these URLs will work correctly:

✅ `https://www.styly.fr/blog/science-couleur-design-comment-ia-aide-choisir-palette-parfaite/`
✅ `https://www.styly.fr/blog/10-conseils-experts-economiser-decoration-interieure-2025/`
✅ `https://www.styly.fr/services-api/`
✅ `https://www.styly.fr/styly-pro/`
✅ `https://www.styly.fr/pricing/`
✅ `https://www.styly.fr/blog/`
✅ All other French routes in your sitemap

## 🔧 Testing

After deployment, test these URLs directly in your browser:
1. `https://www.styly.fr/blog/`
2. `https://www.styly.fr/styly-pro/`
3. `https://www.styly.fr/blog/science-couleur-design-comment-ia-aide-choisir-palette-parfaite/`

They should load the React app and display the correct content, not a 404 error.

## 📊 Key Points

1. **Static files** (images, CSS, JS) are served directly
2. **All other routes** serve `index.html` and let React Router handle routing
3. **Trailing slash redirects** are preserved for SEO consistency
4. **Security headers** are included for production safety
5. **Caching rules** optimize performance

## 🚨 Important Notes

- The SPA routing configuration **must be the last rule** in your server config
- Static file rules **must come before** the SPA fallback rule
- Test thoroughly after deployment to ensure all routes work
- Monitor your server logs for any remaining 404 errors

## 🎉 Result

Once properly configured, your French-focused canonical URL structure will work perfectly with direct URL access, eliminating all 404 errors and providing a seamless user experience!
