# Video End CTA Fix - Test Guide

## What Was Fixed

1. **Removed internal state management from InteriorRevealVideo**
   - The component was managing its own `hasEnded` state and showing a static final frame
   - This prevented the parent component from transitioning to the CTA screens
   - Now the component simply plays the video and calls `onVideoEnd` when done

2. **Fixed Remotion sequence duration**
   - Changed from `durationInFrames={Infinity}` to `durationInFrames={450 - revealStart}`
   - This ensures the video properly ends at frame 450

3. **Added detailed logging**
   - Enhanced console logs to track the transition flow

## How to Test

1. **Clear localStorage** (to reset generation count)
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('styly_staging_generations')
   ```

2. **Open the app and trigger the staging modal**

3. **Upload an image and generate**

4. **Watch the console logs** - You should see:
   ```
   [InteriorRevealVideo] Video ended, calling onVideoEnd immediately
   [onVideoEnd] Called - Starting transition logic
   [onVideoEnd] Generation count: 1 Parsed: 1 Limit: 1
   [onVideoEnd] Count >= Limit, setting step to limit-reached
   [Step Change] New step: limit-reached
   ```

5. **Verify the CTA appears** after the video ends

## Expected Behavior

### First Generation (limit not reached â†’ limit reached):
1. Video plays showing the transformation
2. Video ends after 15 seconds
3. Immediately transitions to "limit-reached" CTA
4. Shows "Start Free Trial" button

### Subsequent Opens (limit already reached):
1. Modal opens directly to "limit-reached" CTA
2. No video plays

## Debugging Tips

If the CTA still doesn't show:
1. Check if `onVideoEnd` is being called in the console
2. Verify the step transition occurs
3. Check for any JavaScript errors
4. Ensure the AnimatePresence animation completes
5. Look for any CSS issues that might hide the content

## Console Commands for Testing

```javascript
// Check current generation count
console.log('Generation count:', localStorage.getItem('styly_staging_generations'))

// Reset generation count
localStorage.setItem('styly_staging_generations', '0')

// Force limit reached
localStorage.setItem('styly_staging_generations', '1')
```
