            Understanding Gen Z’s Aesthetic Preferences
          </h3>
          <p>
            Gen Z isn’t satisfied with cookie-cutter designs. They’re blending
            bold aesthetics, nostalgic touches, and functionality to make their
            spaces truly unique. Here’s a look into their design preferences:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Color Palettes</li>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Gen Z gravitates toward vibrant color combinations. Think sage
              green, lavender, muted pinks, and splashes of bold yellows or
              blues. Their preference? Personalizing spaces with colors that
              reflect individuality while keeping a cozy vibe.
            </p>
            <li>Eclectic Furniture and Decor</li>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Instead of mainstream furniture collections, Gen Z hunts for
              unique vintage finds, second-hand treasures, and quirky accent
              pieces. It’s style-meets-sustainability on a budget.
            </p>
            <li>Minimalist Meets Maximalist</li>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Gen Z decorates on one extreme or the other. Some lean into
              minimalist Nordic styles with clean lines and whites, while others
              go full maximalist with layered textures, bold patterns, and
              curated clutter that feels intentional.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">
            Key Elements of an Instagram-Worthy Interior
          </h3>
          <p>
            What defines “Instagram-worthy”? It’s all about creating that wow
            factor. These elements can make any room pop both in real life and
            on camera:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Natural Lighting</li>
            <p>
              Lighting can make or break your photos. Large windows, sheer
              curtains, and strategically placed mirrors maximize the natural
              light. Think soft and diffused, not harsh.
            </p>
            <li>Accent Walls</li>
            <p>
              From funky wallpaper to a gallery of art, accent walls are a
              striking focal point. Popular choices include geometric murals,
              DIY photo walls, and plant-covered walls.
            </p>
            <li>Statement Pieces</li>
            <p>
              Maybe it’s a retro velvet couch or a neon sign above the bed.
              Statement pieces anchor the room’s aesthetics and create visual
              interest.
            </p>
            <li>Greenery and Plants</li>
            <p>
              Every Instagram-worthy room has some green. From lush monstera
              leaves to hanging ivy, plants bring vibrancy and life to a space.
            </p>
            <li>Layered Textures</li>
            <p>
              Think soft rugs, chunky blankets, fluffy pillows, and textured
              wallpapers. Layering textures adds depth, making the room feel
              both visually dynamic and cozy.
            </p>
            <li>Decluttered Visuals</li>
            <p>
              While Gen Z embraces curated chaos, clutter that’s well-organized
              is key. Decorative baskets, minimalist shelves, and hidden storage
              keep the scene crisp and clean for the camera.
            </p>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800">
            Incorporating Sustainability and Technology
          </h3>
          <p>
            Gen Z doesn’t just care about aesthetics—they care about the planet
            and staying connected. Here’s how they integrate sustainability and
            smart tech into their designs:
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-base font-bold text-gray-800">
            Sustainable Materials
          </h2>
          <p>
            Eco-conscious design is non-negotiable for this generation. Think
            recycled wood furniture, bamboo decor, and upcycled pieces from
            thrift stores. They prioritize ethical choices over fast furniture
            trends.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-base font-bold text-gray-800">
            Smart Home Technology
          </h2>
          <p>
            Integrating tech like voice-controlled lights, smart speakers, and
            app-enabled air purifiers is common. Tools like home decor AI free
            platforms, like Styly’s AI room planner, make designing a breeze.
            These tools help visualize layouts and color palettes before
            starting any transformation.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-base font-bold text-gray-800">
            Multi-functional Furniture
          </h2>
          <p>
            Small spaces are optimized with dual-purpose furniture—think storage
            ottomans, foldable desks, and Murphy beds. It’s trendy AND
            practical.

            </li>
            <p>
              A kitchen with industrial bar stools, subway tiles, and niche
