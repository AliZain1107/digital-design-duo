🧠 Designing the Future of Spaces with AI
At Styly.io, we’re on a mission to democratize interior and exterior design through artificial intelligence. We offer a free AI-powered platform that helps users — from homeowners to real estate agents — transform empty or outdated rooms into beautifully designed spaces, using only a photo or a short prompt. Whether it’s a new floor, cabinetry, wallpaper, or a full renovation — our platform delivers results in seconds, no design skills needed.

But delivering real-time, photorealistic AI staging at scale isn’t simple. That’s where AWS comes in.

☁️ How AWS Powers the Magic Behind Styly
We chose AWS as the foundation for Styly.io because it offers flexibility, scalability, and a robust suite of AI/ML infrastructure tools. Here’s how our current architecture works:

🛠 System Architecture:

API Gateway: Handles secure user input and controls usage

Lambda: Processes photos and prepares data for AI inference

SageMaker: Runs our proprietary generative models to redesign rooms

EC2 (GPU-backed): Used for high-performance rendering in specific cases

S3: Secure, encrypted storage of both user uploads and generated designs

CloudFront: Ensures fast global delivery of final results

This modular architecture allows us to process and return complete AI interior design visuals in under 10 seconds.

🔐 Built for Privacy and Compliance
As a French-based startup, we prioritize compliance with GDPR and other data privacy regulations. AWS provides tools like encrypted S3 buckets, IAM roles, and monitoring via CloudWatch to ensure secure and compliant handling of all user data and visual content.

🚀 The Role of AWS in Startup Acceleration
One of the most powerful aspects of AWS is its startup-first ecosystem.

As part of the AWS Activate and Startups programs, we’ve received:

Cloud credits to grow and experiment quickly

Architecture guidance from AWS solution architects

Access to startup showcases and go-to-market support

Opportunities for global visibility alongside other cutting-edge AI companies

AWS isn’t just infrastructure — it’s a growth engine. They’ve helped us move from idea to product, from local to global.

🌍 What’s Next for Styly.io
Styly.io is just getting started. In 2025 and beyond, we’re focused on:

Edge AI: Bringing real-time, device-level rendering to phones and tablets

Localized style models: Interior styles trained on regional preferences (Scandinavian minimalism, French classic, Japanese zen)

E-commerce integration: Letting users click and shop products directly from their design

Virtual collaboration: Real-time sharing and editing between clients, decorators, and builders

And through our Founding Partners Program, we’re inviting designers, real estate agents, and home brands to co-build this future with us.

✅ Conclusion: From Idea to Global Impact
Styly.io is more than just a free AI interior design tool. It’s a platform that makes professional-quality staging and remodeling accessible to anyone, anywhere — all powered by intelligent infrastructure from AWS.
